### David Chung, Mia Kobayashi

Dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
For this project, we specifically looked at the [IMDb Movies Extensive Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset) that includes 85,855 movies from 1874 to planned movies released in 2027.
The dataset from Kaggle included 4 files, a movies, ratings, a names, and a title principals dataset.

For this project, we only chose to look at the movies dataset as it included attributes like movie title and title id, average rating, number of votes, genre (up to 3), year and date of release, the country the movie was produced in, budget, etc.  And the other datasets didnâ€™t have information that was pertinent to the analyzations we wanted to perform.

#### The Comparisons:
- Country vs. Number of Movies Produced (over the time frame of the dataset)
- Time (year) vs. Movie Ratings
 - Time (month) vs. Movie Ratings
- Time (year) vs. Movie Budget
- Budget vs. US Gross Income in the U.S.
- Budget, Metascore, Average Vote vs. Gross Income in the U.S.
- Duration vs. Genre
- Genre vs. Average Vote
- Average Vote vs. Metascore
