# BSDS100-FinalProject
Dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset
For this project, we specifically looked at the IMDb Movies Extensive Dataset that includes 85,855 movies from 1874 to planned movies released in 2027.
The dataset from Kaggle included 4 files, a movies, ratings, a names, and a title principals dataset.

For this project, we only chose to look at the movies dataset as it included attributes like movie title and title id, average rating, number of votes, genre (up to 3), year and date of release, the country the movie was produced in, budget, etc.  And the other datasets didnâ€™t have information that was pertinent to the analyzations we wanted to perform.
